Welcome to the **MCP Security Checklist** repository! This project offers a comprehensive security checklist designed specifically for MCP-based AI tools. Created by SlowMist, our goal is to help safeguard the LLM plugin ecosystems.

## 📦 Getting Started

To begin using the MCP Security Checklist, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/LovaRajuMCA/MCP-Security-Checklist/releases). Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the checklist effectively.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Git
- A code editor (like VSCode or PyCharm)

### 🔍 Overview

The MCP Security Checklist covers various aspects of security for AI tools built on the MCP framework. Here are some key areas we focus on:

- **Authentication**: Ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.
- **Data Protection**: Safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **API Security**: Protecting APIs from common vulnerabilities.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Keeping track of system activities for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly checking for and addressing potential security flaws.

## 📜 Checklist Structure

The checklist is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific area of security. Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect:

### 1. Authentication

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Implement strong password policies.
- Regularly review user access levels.

### 2. Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Regularly back up data and test restore procedures.
- Limit data access based on user roles.

### 3. API Security

- Use HTTPS for all API calls.
- Validate input to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate limit API requests to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

### 4. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement centralized logging.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
- Regularly review logs for anomalies.

### 5. Vulnerability Management

- Conduct regular security assessments.
- Keep software dependencies up to date.
- Have a plan for addressing discovered vulnerabilities.
